# TowerSiege-1

I have to do the following things:

1. Make a copy of the following files created in the Angry bird game in the class:
a. Ground Javascript file.
b. box javascript file.
c. Slingshot javascript.

2. Add these files to your project and add these file names to index.html.

3. In sketch.js, create an object using Ground Class. 

4. Create an object for the Stand (which is the base to hold the blocks) using the same ground Class.

5. Create multiple objects using the Box class and stack them in a way that the structire looks like a pyramid.
    .Here is an example of the code snippet for creating this structure.
    
6. Create an object called Polygon using the Bodies and add it to the world.

7. Add and image to the polygon object using the concepts taught in class C25. (See Hints on how to do this).

8. Link the Polygon (bodyA) to the Slingshot Class with a pointB.

9. Adjust the posirtion of the Polygon such that it is aimed at the pyramid at a certain distance from the stand.

10. Add the mouseDragged and mouseReleased event in the sketch.js to launch the polygon on the pyramid.

11. Update the fly() method to set the bodyA to null.

12. Make sure the project work before you submit it.
